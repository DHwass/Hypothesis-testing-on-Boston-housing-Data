# Hyptohesis Testing on Boston Housing Data

## Project Overview

As a Data Scientist with a housing agency in Boston, MA, this project aims to provide valuable insights into housing prices based on a dataset derived from the U.S. Census Service. The analysis is conducted to aid upper management in making informed decisions. Four key questions are addressed to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships within the data.

## Questions Explored

### Q1: Charles River Influence on Median House Values
*Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not?*

### Q2: Impact of Proportion of Pre-1940 Owner-Occupied Units
*Is there a difference in median values of houses based on the proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?*

### Q3: Relationship between Nitric Oxide Concentrations and Business Acres
*Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?*

### Q4: Weighted Distance to Employment Centres and Median Home Values
*What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centres on the median value of owner-occupied homes?*

## Methodology

The analysis employs statistical techniques to address each question, offering insights and conclusions. Hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling may be utilized as appropriate.
